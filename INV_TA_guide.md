# Guide for Super TAs and TAs

## TAs

### Task during exercise sessions

When you enter the room at the beginning of your shift, you should:
- Draw rectangle on a blackboard indicating your list, write your name (or names, if you are sharing the room with another TA) clearly stating e.g. "TAs Martin and Jonas B., 15:00-17:00". You need to have an unique TA name. (For evaluation, you want students to write that you have been helpful!)
- Address the people in the room by saying e.g. "My name is Martin, I am fifth-semester student studying Physics and Nanotechnology, and I will be your TA today."
- Explain that you expect them to write their names on the list, regardless of how many (or few) are waiting for help. We use this to keep track of the demand for help.

During your shift you should:
- Help people from your list. Give them the direction to move on.
- If your list is exhausted, and no questions are asked, initiate contact and show interest. Ask the students how it's going, how far are they, what they find difficult, what would they whish for... Get engaged.

Upon entering a room where exercises with TA help are conducted, I want to see:
- TAs. (Wear your T-shirt -- which we need to get). Your name badge should include your name. 
- TAs talking with students. 
- A list clearly showing how many students have been helped, and how many students are waiting to be helped.
