# Assignments, simple data types, built-in operators and functions

Computers are good at storing data and performing computation. In this week we will learn how to store data in variables, and how to perform simple computation and manipulation on them. In particular, this weeks topics are:

- Assignment statement.
- Simple data types (integers, floats, strings, and booleans).
- Built-in operators.
- Some simple functions.
