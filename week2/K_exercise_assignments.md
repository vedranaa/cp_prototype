# Exercise on assignments
**EXERCISE. DURATION: 120min**


TODOS:
* Videos for some solutions. 
* Voting for problems which should be solved in additional videos.
* Explain exactly how they should proceed. Make one `.py` file for each problem? Or modify the same file?

## Instructions
In problems included in this exercise, we first describe a situation where, during the execution of a program, you encounter a specific variable with a certain value. For instance, we might state that you have a variable `a` with the value `3`. In all the problems in this section, the specific value provided is just an example to illustrate the concept. The value of `a` could be any*different* integer number, such as `155`. To keep the problem text short, we won't repeatedly emphasize this in every problem.

We then ask you to define another variable which has a specific type and a concrete value. To achieve this, you must somehow *utilize* the given variable without directly referencing its example value. In other words, you need to construct an assignment where the left side is a correct variable name, the right side is an appropriate expression involving the given variable. For example, after introducing `a = 3`, we might ask you to define an integer variable `b` with a value that is twice the value of `a`. Clearly, the value of `b` should be `6`. However, writing `b = 6` doesn't fulfill the objective, because you *performed the computation* yourself, and you should let the computer do the computation for you. Writing `b = 2 * 3` is not a correct solution either, because you *remembered the value* of variable `a` yourself, and you should let the computer store and retrieve values for you. To use the computers ability to store data and perform computation, you should solve the problem by writing `b = 2 * a`. Now, even if the value of `a` were a different integer, like `19084`, the value of `b` would be twice the value of `a`.

In some of the problems, you may be given more than one variable, or simply an explanation of the variable type. In some of the problems, you might need to perform multiple assignments to solve the problem. 

For some problems we will provide the solution. In the first part of the exercise, problems are simpler and grouped based on the variable type. As you progress through the exercise, you'll encounter scenarios where you need to use various variable types to find solutions. 

Some problems are chained and can be solved by changing the previous solution just a little bit. For chained problems, you can copy the previous solution and just make the needed modification.

## Exercises

1. You have two float variables representing the length and the width of a room in meters, say
    ```python
    a = 5.7
    b = 3.9 
    ``` 
    Define a boolean value `bed_fits`, which should assume a value `True` if and only if a bed of the size 2-by-0.9 meters fits in the room.

    **Solution**:
   
2. Say you have a variable `k` of the type float, and it represents...

    **Solution:** To test the assignment which solves the problem, we need to assign some value to `k`.  

    #### Integeres (and booleans)
   
3. Make an assignment which creates a integer variable `year`. Its value should be the current year.

4. You have an integer variable `nr_books` indicating the number of books in the library. Make a variable `nr_pages` with the number of pages in all books, if you know that a book has in average 97 pages.

5. You make a web page with recipes. Each recipe is written for 4 people, but the user can choose any number of people. Given variable `nr_eggs_4` ...

6. You have two integer variable representing hours in 24-hour notation. This means that the hour value is always smaller than 24, since one hours grow from 0 to 23, and than start again from 0. The two variables are for example `hours_1 = 16`, and `hours_2 = 12`. Define a variable `hours_sum` which is a sum of two hours, but also 24-hour representation. 

7. In the previous problem, you knew that both `hours_1` and `hours_2` are smaller than 24. Make sure that your definition of `hours_sum` is a correct hour sum in the 24-hour representation, even if the two variables `hours_1` and `hours_2` are larger than 24. It can be, that you don't need to change anything.

8. Similar to previous problem, define the variable `minutes` which is the sum of `minutes_1` and `minutes_2`, but is valid minutes part of the given time, i.e. it should be a number between 0 and 59. 

9. You are writing a program which displays photographs in a grid. The variable representing the number of photographs is `nr_photos`. The user chooses the number of photos to be shown in each row, represented by the value `nr_columns`. The last row may contain fewer photos than `nr_columns`. Define a variable `nr_full_rows` which is a number of rows in the grid which contain `nr_columns` photographs. For example if you have
    ```python
    N = 17
    c = 3 
    ``` 
    The first 15 photos are shown in 5 rows, with 3 photos in each row. The last 2 photos are shown in the 6th row. So, the number of full rows is 5.

1. Continuation of the previous problem. Define the variable `has_extra_row` which is `True` if the last row of photographs contains fewer that `nr_columns` photographs. For the example from previous problem, this variable would be `True`.

2. Continuation of the previous problem. Define the variable `nr_rows` which is the number of rows needed to display all photographs. For the example from the previous problem, you need 6 rows to display the photos. Hint: Notice that `nr_rows` is either `nr_full_rows` or one larger, if `has_extra_rows` is `True` (which is represented by 1).

    b = 3.9 
    ```

8. Given the length (in meters) of a room in a variable `length`, define a variable `bed_fits` which has the value `True` if a bed of the length 200cm fits in the room. You can assume that the room has sufficient width.

9. Given the length and a width (in meters) of a room in variables `length` and `width`, define a variable `bed_fits` which has the value `True` if a bed of the size 200cm-by-90cm fits in the room. You can assume that the length is larger than the width.

9. Given the dimesions of the room in the variables `a` and `b`, define `length` and `width`. Here, you don't know which of the variables `a` and `b` is smaller, and which is bigger.

ADVANCED:
1. Consider variable-swap. Usuall, one would use a temporary variable. But if the values are numerical, swap can be done without a a temporary variable. How? Hint: Start by choosing one of the variables, and assigning it a value which is a sum of the two values. Now consider the variable which you didn't change. Which value should it have at the end? And can you compute this value from the values you have? After you figure out this step, consider the other variable. 
2. The previous approach will not work if the sum of the two values is too large to be represented by the current data type. Can you come up with a solution which uses subtraction instead of addition?
