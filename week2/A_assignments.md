# Variables and assignments

Program is text. Commands given to computer.

Variable has: name, type and value. 
Name is used in the program text. Unique, needs to adhere to syntax rules, usually adheres to some custom.
Type says what kind of variable it is. There are many types of variables. For now we work three types: int, float, str.
Value is the actual content of the variable, different types have different contents.
Extra. Under the hood, each variable refers to some memory storage. Floating point representation. Integer representations. String representation

The coder needs to consider all these aspects: appropriate type, appropriate name, value which fits the need.

Operations
Exercises with simple assignment and printing of int, float, str
Operations: Int's and float's: +, -, *, /, //, %, **, Str's: +, * int 
Casting
Assignments involving other variables.

Making changes to a variable:
For now, all variables are unmutable -- no changes can be made. 
Re-assignments is always possible -- using the same name, usually keeping the type.

- Check which built-in functions are relevant https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
- 

Maybe: mathematical functions form math package. (Packages)
Maybe: Boolean variables
Maybe: Floating-point representation
