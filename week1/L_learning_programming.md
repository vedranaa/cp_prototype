# How to learn to program?
**TEXT AND VIDEOS**

**Programming is a skill.** Programming is a skill which takes a long time to master. Like with other skills (for example, playing a musical instrument, kite-surfing or knitting) reading a text or watching a video will give you the needed information to accomplish the skill, but it is far from enough. You need to practice. You need to practice writing programs. The more you practice, the better you will become.

Whether you are beginner or experienced programmer, you can always further improve your skills. 

**It takes time.** Accomplishing any skill takes time. The comics below makes fun of literature promising to teach programming skills very fast. As the author of the comics writes, the very basics of the programming language may be covered in 21 days, but much longer time is needed to become a proficient programmer. In other words, there is no fast-and-easy way of acquiring the programming skill (or playing clarinet, or learning Portugese).

**Having a schedule helps.** The best way of acomplishing a skill is to establish a practicing schedule and stick to it. The schedule should be realistic, and the progress should be steady.
