# How to learn to program?
**TEXT**

**Programming is a skill.** Like with other skills (for example, playing a musical instrument, kite-surfing or knitting) reading a text or watching a video will give you the needed information to accomplish the skill, but it is not enough. To master a skill you need to practice. And to learn to program you need practice writing programs. The more you practice, the better you will become.

Whether you are beginner or experienced programmer, you can always further improve your skills. 

**It takes time.** Mastering any skill takes time. The comics below makes fun of books and courses promising to teach programming skills very fast. As the author of the comics writes, the very basics of the programming language may be covered in 21 days, but much longer time is needed to become a proficient programmer. In other words, there is no fast-and-easy way of acquiring the programming skill (or playing clarinet, or learning Portugese).

**Having a schedule helps.** The best way of master a skill is to establish a practicing schedule and stick to it. The schedule should be realistic, the progress should be steady, and you should practice consistently. 

This course is providing you with a schedule for learning the basics of programming. The most important ingredient to your success in the course is the time you invest.
