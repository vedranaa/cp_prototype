## What is Python?

The full description of Phyton is available at the [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
The documentation is complete, and every feature of the language is described in detail. It may therefore be difficult for unexperienced programmers to identify the specific information they need. Nevertheless, the documentation is a valuable resource for we will link to it throughout the course. (Think of it as a user manual for Python, similar to the user manual for a car.)

[Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is a good place to start learning Python, but it can still be a bit overwhelming for beginners. We will therefore provide a more gentle introduction to the language in this course.
