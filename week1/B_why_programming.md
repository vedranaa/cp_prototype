# Why learn programming? And why learn Python?
**TEXT AND VIDEOS**


## Why learn programming?
Programming is an essential skill for students at technical universities. In 2023, the revised [Polytechnic foundation](https://www.dtu.dk/uddannelse/bachelor/uddannelsens-opbygning/det-polytekniske-grundlag) placed programming at the first semester for all bachelor study lines at DTU. You will benefit from programming skills in your studies, your future career, and in everyday life.

## Why learn Python?
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in science and engineering. According to [TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index)) Python is in 2024 the most popular programming language and still gaining popularity. Python is simple, and easy to learn. It is used in scientific fields including physics, chemistry, biology, life science and data science, and many Python libraries are available for these fields. 

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language developed in 1991, with current version, Python 3, being released in 2008. The [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) describes features of Python in full detail.
Unexperienced programmers may have hard time trying to find the specific information in Python documentation. Nevertheless, the documentation is a valuable resource for we will link to its specific parts it throughout the course. (Think of the documentation as of a detailed user manual, similar to the user manual for a car.)

[Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is a good place to start learning Python, but it can still be overwhelming for beginners. We will therefore provide a more gentle introduction to the Python language, and programming in general, in this course.
