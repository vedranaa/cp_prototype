# Try-it editor

You can try out Python code in the editor below. Just write your code in the editor and press the "Run" button. The output will be displayed below the editor.

{%- include tryit.html -%}

This editor supports only a smaller subset of Python, and should be used only for very simple code snippets. For more complex code, and when you rely for informative error messages, you should use a proper Python development environment. 

<!-- 
{%- capture mycode -%}
print("Hello, world!")
{%- endcapture -%}

{%- include tryit.html mycode=mycode -%}
-->
