# How to take this course?

## Course Content

The basics. Like driving course. Not Chat-GPT.

## Exercises (OK to wait reading this until later, or introduce as-we-go.)

Exercises are an essential part of this course. In the beginning of the course, we will provide solutions and clear guidelines to the exercises. As you progress, you will be expected to test your own code. For this, wou will meet exercises in different formats:

- **T'n'T (Template-and-Test)**: In this exercise, we provide both a template file and a test file.
- **T (Test)**: Here, we provide a test file so you can test your solution.
- **DIY (Do-It-Yourself)**: In these exercises, you need to both write your solution and test it.

## Explanation of Provided Files

### Template File

A template file is a Python file with a predefined template for the solution. It already has the correct file name, and some lines of code are pre-written, including the function header and documentation. The template file also contains a **TODO** section where you need to insert your solution to the programming task. We provide a template for two main reasons:

- To ensure that your solution has the correct filename and function names, preventing issues with submission.
- To save you time and effort by providing predefined code segments.

### Test File

A test file is a Python file that you can run to test your solution. It compares your solution with the correct one. Sometimes, the test file may contain more advanced Python code than what we've covered in the course. We provide test files for the following reasons:

- To help you verify the correctness of your solution or improve an incorrect one.
- To save you time and effort in writing test cases.
