# How to take this course?

TODO. All this needs to be aligned with the actual content of the course.

## Course Content

This page describes the different types of activities you will encounter in the course. You can skim this page now, and we will refer to it the first time we introduce a specific type of activity.

## Exercises

Exercises are an essential part of this course. We have different types of exercises: 

- **Copy-and-run**: These exercises are designed to help you get familiar with the new content. You will be asked to copy some code, run (execute) it, and observe the output. This will help you understand the code and its behavior. You might need to make small modifications to the code, but for copy-and-run you will not be asked to compose some code or a program yourself. We expect all students to be able to complete these exercises without help from the TAs, so these exercises are scheduled as a part of the preparation. If you have trouble with copy-and-run exercises, review the material, and keep trying until you can complete them.

- **Achieve behavior**: In these exercises you will practice writing the code that does something specific. Every exercise is linked with a specific copy-and-run exercise providing a hint on how to achieve the desired behavior. We expect the students to be able to complete these exercises with minimal help from the TAs.
  
- **Problem solving**: In these exercises, you will be asked to write code which solves a specific problem. When solving the problems, you are advised to look back at the copy-and-run and achieve behavior exercises. Problem solving exercises are most challenging, but if you completed all the copy-and-run and achieve behavior exercises, you should have a good foundation for solving these exercises. The final exam and the project submissions contain problem solving exercises.


When solving problems, you will also be asked to test your solution. Exercises will vary regarding how you test your solution:

- **T'n'T (Template-and-Test)**: In this exercise, we provide both a template file and a test file.
- **T (Test)**: Here, we provide a test file so you can test your solution.
- **DIY (Do-It-Yourself)**: In these exercises, you need to both write your solution and test it.


**Template File** A template file is a Python file with a predefined template for the solution. It already has the correct file name, and some lines of code are pre-written, including the function header and documentation. The template file also contains a **TODO** section where you need to insert your solution to the programming task. We provide a template for two main reasons:

- To ensure that your solution has the correct filename and function names, preventing issues with submission.
- To save you time and effort by providing predefined code segments.

**Test File** A test file is a Python file that you can run to test your solution. It compares your solution with the correct one. Sometimes, the test file may contain more advanced Python code than what we've covered in the course. We provide test files for the following reasons:

- To help you verify the correctness of your solution or improve an incorrect one.
- To save you time and effort in writing test cases.

## Quizzes
- **Self-assessment** Quizzes are provided to help you check your understanding of the material. Always open and not graded.
- **Weekly quizzes** are open for a limited time, you can take and submit them during classes. The weekly quizzes contribute to your final score.
- **Progress trackers** Open for limited time such that you can enter your current progress, allowing you to see whether you are on track, and allowing the teachers to adjust the pace if needed.
- **Course interaction (survey)** A means to influence the course of the course.
