# Writing and executing programs
**STATUS: DRAFT. PLAN: TEXT AND VIDEOS. DURATION: 30min**

There are many ways to write and execute programs. Experienced programmers will use advanced tools (code editors), which are usually highly customizable and have a lot of features. For beginners, such tools can be overwhelming. (You can again think of the car analogy: when just learning to drive, you may be distracted by auto pilot and navigation systems, despite those being useful features for experienced drivers.)

As most students in this course are complete beginners, we will start with simple tools. Around the middle of the course we will also introduce more advanced tools, and you will be able to choose the tool that suits you best.

## Code editors
Code editors are programs designed to help you write code. They have features that make writing code easier and more efficient. To explain what code editors provide, let's compare them to text editors. A text editor, for example Microsoft Word, can make writing process much easier. It provides spelling check, copy and paste, searching and replacing, treasuries, and many other features. Clearly, you **could** write a book without a text editor, but it would be much harder. Code editors provide similar features, but they are tailored for writing code.

Apart from helping you to write the code, most code editors have features that help you to run the code. Such editors are called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Some popular IDEs for Python are Visual Studio Code, Sypder, and PyCharm. In this course, we will start with a simple code editor, IDLE, which comes with Python installation. Later, you may switch to Visual Studio Code.

## Other ways of running python code
Executing python `.py` files from a command line or from IDE is a direct way of running python code. Python code may be used in other ways, and it has become popular to run python code from a so-called *Jupyter notebook*. Jupyter notebook is a web-based interactive environment for writing and running code. It is widely used in data science and machine learning. It is also used for teaching because it allows to combine code, text, and images in one document.

Jupyter notebooks may be run on your computer, but there are also online services that allow you to run Jupyter notebooks without installing anything on your computer.

The focus of this course is on writing and running python code, regardless of whether it is run from a `.py` file, from an IDE or in a Jupyter notebook. To solve assignments in the course you will need to write python code in a `.py` file. We will not be using Jupyter notebooks, but you might want to try them.
