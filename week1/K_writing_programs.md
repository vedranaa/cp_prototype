# Writing and executing programs
**TEXT AND VIDEOS**

There are many ways to write and execute programs. Experienced programmers will use advanced tools (code editors), which are usually highly customizable and have a lot of features. For beginners, such tools can be overwhelming. (You can again think of the car analogy: when just learning to drive, you may be distracted by auto pilot and navigation systems, despite those being useful features for experienced drivers.)

As most students in this course are complete beginners, we will start with simple tools. Around the middle of the course we will also introduce more advanced tools, and you will be able to choose the tool that suits you best.

## Code editors
Code editors are programs designed to help you write code. They have features that make writing code easier and more efficient. To explain what code editors provide, let's compare them to text editors. A text editor, for example Microsoft Word, can make writing process much easier. It provides spelling check, copy and paste, searching and replacing, treasuries, and many other features. Clearly, you **could** write a book without a text editor, but it would be much harder. Code editors provide similar features, but they are tailored for writing code.

Apart from helping you to write the code, most code editors have features that help you to run the code. Some popular code editors for Python are Visual Studio Code, Sypder, and PyCharm. In this course, we will start with a simple code editor, IDLE, which comes with Python installation. Later, you may switch to Visual Studio Code.
