# Get to know your computer

**STATUS: EARLY DRAFT. PLAN: EXERCISE AND SELF-EVALUATION QUIZ. DURATION: 60min**

In this exercise you will get more familiar with your computer's file system and CLI. Fill in the self-evaluation quiz to make sure that you have understood the exercise.

## Exercise

TODO: explain clearly how to do every step.

Open the file browser provided by you operating system: Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. If you don't yet have a folder dedicated to the programming course, make it now. Chose a suitable name for that folder. We will call it 'programming' folder. Open CLI and arrange your windows such that you both can see CLI and the file browser. 

Create a text file in the programming folder. One way of doing this is to open a text editor, write some text, and save the file in the programming folder. 

Often, you want to download a file and store it on your computer. Let's practice this. Link to python file. Download, make week1, place in programming folder, and open in text editor.
