# Files, folders, paths and command line interface

**STATUS: DRAFT. PLAN: TEXT AND VIDEOS. DURATION:30min**

Computers have become integral to almost every professional and personal activity, making them accessible to people of all backgrounds. For many, the computer serves as a tool for browsing the internet, managing bank accounts, and organizing documents, such as texts, photographs, and music. These activities are user-friendly and typically require minimal knowledge of the computer's underlying organization.

However, when it comes to programming, gaining insight into the computer's inner workings becomes essential. In this text we will cover the basic concepts of the computer's file system and the command line interface (CLI). These concepts are fundamental to understanding how to write and execute programs.


## Files, folders, paths
Files and Folders:
The information in the computer is organized into files and folders. TODO

Paths:
Knowing the correct path ensures that you, or your program, can locate the necessary resources. TODO









If you don't provide a full path of the resource which you expect your program to use, your computer will try to find it according to some rules.


## Command line interface

Using command line interface(CLI) CLI to navigate in your computer folder structure. 
GUI is often easier to use, but CLI gives an view which is more alike to the true organization. For example, GUI might present some resource as if it is stored on your computer, while in reality it is stored online. Likewise, GUI will usually omit displaying certain (hidden) files and folders, and might not show file extensions.

Often-used commands:
- `ls` - list files and folders in the current directory
- `cd` - change directory, `cd ..` to go up one level, `cd foldername` to go to a folder ´foldername´
- `pwd` - print working directory

Executing programs from the command line interface:
- `python` - start the python interpreter
- `python filename.py` - execute the python program stored in the file `filename.py`


Executing MS Word from the command line interface:
- `winword` - start MS Word
- `winword filename.docx` - open the file `filename.docx` in MS Word
