# Files, folders, paths and command line interface

**STATUS: DRAFT. PLAN: TEXT AND VIDEOS. DURATION:30min**

Computers have become integral to almost every professional and personal activity, making them accessible to people of all backgrounds. For many, the computer serves as a tool for browsing the internet, managing bank accounts, and organizing documents, such as texts, photographs, and music. These activities are user-friendly and typically require minimal knowledge of the computer's underlying organization.

However, when it comes to programming, gaining insight into the computer's inner workings becomes essential. In this text we will cover the basic concepts of the computer's file system and the command line interface (CLI). These concepts are fundamental to understanding how to write and execute programs.


## Files and folders
The information in the computer is organized into files and folders (also called directories). 
File extensions. Data and programs.

Python files have the extension `.py`. 




## Paths
Knowing the correct path ensures that you, or your program, can locate the necessary resources. 

### Absolute and relative paths.

If you don't provide a full path of the resource which you expect your program to use, your computer will try to find it according to some rules.

## Command line interface

An interface is a way to interact with a computer. A command line interface (CLI) allows you to interact with the computer by writing text. You are probably more familiar with the graphical user interface (GUI), where you interact with the computer by clicking on icons, buttons, and menus. However, the CLI is still widely used, especially in programming and system administration.

CLI will often gives you more control over the computer than GUI. For example, you can see the hidden files and folders, and perform operations not accessible via GUI. Using CLI requires caution, as you can accidentally delete or modify important files.

It is possible to learn to program in Python without using the CLI, but it is recommended to learn the basics of CLI, as it will give you a better understanding of how the computer works.

### Basic commands
We are only going to cover two features of CLI: navigating the file system and executing programs.

Windows, Mac, and Linux have different CLIs.

Often-used commands:
- `ls` - list files and folders in the current directory
- `cd` - change directory, `cd ..` to go up one level, `cd foldername` to go to a folder ´foldername´
- `pwd` - print working directory

Executing programs from the command line interface:
- `python` - start the python interpreter
- `python filename.py` - execute the python program stored in the file `filename.py`


Executing MS Word from the command line interface:
- `winword` - start MS Word
- `winword filename.docx` - open the file `filename.docx` in MS Word
