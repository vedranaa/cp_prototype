# Flatten photos
**MINI-PROJECT**

# FLATTEN PHOTOS
Photographs of foliage over several years have been collected for a science project. The photographs are saved in a folder structure with years, month names, and dates. To analyze the photos in an externally developed software, you need a flat folder with photographs. For your convenience, you would like that the names of photographs reflect the chronology of collecting photos.

We have provided you with the data, and the code to be used to flatten the photographs.
