- Make external js file for quiz and question support. Combine the code for the two: the check_radios and check_checkbox should take a table (or panes) as input, the feedback is accessed as the last element of the questions panel, which is a parent of table. 
- Make check_question function which calls either check_radios or check_checkbox, and disables button.
- Resets should be reset_question and reset_quiz.

- Make external css file for all my additions.
