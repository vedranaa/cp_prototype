# WORDLE

We will work on a simplified version of the game WORDLE. In a pair, spend up to 10 minutes on analyzing this game. Do as much of the following:

- If you don't know the game, try it on [this site](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
- Describe a clear set of rules for the game.
- Discuss whether, and how, you could implement this game with you current programming skills.

We have provided you with some code, that can be used for a very simplified version WORDLE. The code still misses some important features. In particular:
- WORDLE is played on 5-letter words. Currently, words of any length are allowed.
- WORDLE gives feedback to players. Currently, no feedback is given. 
- WORDLE uses 6 tries. Currently, the game continues until the user enters invalid text (empty or containing non-letter characters).

We will explain, how you should modify the code to achieve the desired behavior. First, spend 10 minutes on the following tasks:
- Get the package consisting of a text file and a python script. 
- See the video of a game played on the code that has all the features.
- Ensure that you can run the code.
- Analyze the code. In particular:
  - Look at the function `function name` which loads the words from the text file. A question about the function.
  - Look at the function `function name` which asserts whether the input is valid and/or checks that the user wants to quit. A question about the function.
  - Look at the function `function name` which creates the feedback to the user. A question about the function.


**Hand-in** The function which creates the feedback.
