# Lists

## Motivation

Computer programs are great for processing large amount of information (data). For example, we might want to process some data about every student taking this course, and probably we would need to store the name of each student. One could think that we start something like
```[python]
student1 = 'Mads Aaberg'
student2 = 'Silje Andersen'
student3 = 'Peter Bentson'
```
This would ensure some ordering of students, such that we can process all names in sequence. Instead of creating a variable for each name, we can do better, we can create a *list*.
```[python]
students = ['Mads Aaberg', 'Silje Andersen',  'Peter Bentson']
```
