# Libraries and modules

Topics to be covered:
- Libraries included in standard Python distribution (math, sys, os)
- Installing and using third-party libraries. Pip. Mention commonly used libraries for scientific computation(numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, etc.) but not in detail.
- Writing your own modules. Importing modules.

https://pypi.org: The Python Package Index, previously also nicknamed the Cheese Shop [1], is an index of user-created Python modules that are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it here so that others can find it.
